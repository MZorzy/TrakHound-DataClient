TrakHound Data Server is used to receive MTConnectÂ® data streamed from TrakHound Data Clients and store that data in a database. Supports SSL for secure connections and uses streaming to minimize connections. Currently supports MySQL databases.

# Configuration
Configuration is read from the **server.conf** XML file in the following format:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>
<DataServer>
  <Devices>
    <Device deviceId="1234" deviceName="VMC-3Axis">http://agent.mtconnect.org</Device>
    <Device deviceId="456" deviceName="OKUMA.Lathe">http://74.203.109.245:5001</Device>
  </Devices>
  <DataServers>
    <DataServer url="http://api.trakhound.com" bufferPath="c:\TrakHound\Buffers\">
      <DataTypes>
        <DataType>POSITION</DataType>
        <DataType>STATUS</DataType>
        <DataType>PROGRAM</DataType>
      </DataTypes>
    </DataServer>
  </DataServers>
</DataServer>
```

## Device 
Represents each MTConnect Agent that the Device Server going to be reading from.

#### Device ID 
###### *(XmlAttribute : deviceId)*
The globally unique identifier for the device (usually a GUID)

#### Device Name
###### *(XmlAttribute : deviceName)*
The DeviceName of the MTConnect Device to read from

#### Address
###### *(XmlText)*
The base Url of the MTConnect Agent. Do not specify the Device Name in the url, instead specify it under the deviceName attribute.

## Data Server
Represents each TrakHound Data Server that data is sent to in order to be strored and processed.

#### Url 
###### *(XmlAttribute : url)*
The base Url of the TrakHound Data Server to send data to

#### Buffer Path
###### *(XmlAttribute : bufferPath)*
The directory where the buffer files should be stored. The Buffer is used to store data that hasn't been successfully sent yet.


### DataGroups
DataGroups allow configuration for what data is captured and sent to the DataServer. Data is filtered by Type or by their parent container type. DataGroups can include a list for allowed types as well as for denied types. A CaptureMode can also be defined to configure when the data in the DataGroup is sent.

#### Name
The identifier for the DataGroup. This is primarily used when the DataGroup is being included in another group.

#### CaptureMode
The mode in when data is captured.
  - ACTIVE : Always capture and send data defined in the DataGroup
  - PASSIVE : Only capture and send when included in another DataGroup. This can be used for constantly changing data such as Axis Position to reduce the amount of data stored in the DataServer's database.
  
#### Allow
A list of Types to capture. This can also include container paths with the wildcard character (*) to allow any types within the container.

#### Deny
A list of Types to not capture. This overrides any allowed types.

#### Include
A list of other DataGroups to include when capturing for the current DataGroup. For example, this can be used to capture position data only when another group changes in order to reduce the amount of data stored in the DataServer's database.
